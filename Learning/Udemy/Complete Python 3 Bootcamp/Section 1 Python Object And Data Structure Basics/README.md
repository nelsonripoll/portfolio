# Python Objects and Data Structure Basics

## Python Data Types

| Name           | Type  | Description                            |
|:---------------|:------|:---------------------------------------|
| Integers       | int   | whole numbers                          |
| Floating Point | float | number with a decimal point            |
| Strings        | str   | ordered sequence of characters         |
| Lists          | list  | ordered sequence of objects            |
| Dictionaries   | dict  | unordered key:value pairs              |
| Tuples         | tup   | ordered immutable sequence of objects  |
| Sets           | set   | unordered collection of unique objects |
| Booleans       | bool  | logical values true or false           |

What's the difference between floating point and an integer? An integer has no 
 decimals in it, a floating point number can display digits past the decimal point.

Why doesn't 0.1+0.2-0.3 equal 0.0? This has to do with floating point accuracy 
 and computer's abilities to represent numbers in memory.

## Basic Math In Python

| Name           | Symbol | Example |
|:---------------|:------:|:--------|
| Addition       | +      | 2 + 1   |
| Subtraction    | -      | 2 - 1   |
| Multiplication | *      | 2 \* 1  |
| Division       | /      | 2 / 1   |
| Modulus        | %      | 7 % 4   |
| Exponents      | **     | 2 ** 3  |

Order of Operations: 2 + 10 * 10 + 3 = 105, (2 + 10) * (10 + 3) = 156
